## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability affecting:

- the P0 Security platform itself  
  **please contact our security team directly at security@p0.dev**

- the community-contributed integrations in this repository, please follow these steps:

  1. Check if there is a maintainer listed for the integration in question.
  2. If so, contact that maintainer directly via their listed contact information.
  3. If no maintainer is listed or you are unsure, you may send details to **support@p0.dev**, indicating that your report is about a potential security issue. We will help coordinate an appropriate response with the integration contributor.

## Responsible Disclosure
